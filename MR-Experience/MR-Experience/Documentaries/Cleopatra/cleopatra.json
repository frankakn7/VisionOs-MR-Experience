Educated in <u>Greek and Egyptian</u>, she ascended to power at 18, initially as co-regent with her brother before taking full control, sparking political turmoil. Under her rule, Egypt balanced alliances with Rome through ==Julius Caesar== and ==Mark Antony==, securing its sovereignty. Her romance with Caesar and alliance with Antony led to conflict with ==Octavian==, culminating in their defeat at [the Battle of Actium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium) and their suicides. *Cleopatra's legacy endures as a symbol of Egyptian strength and cultural allure, inspiring art, literature, and film, solidifying her as a captivating figure in history.*",
